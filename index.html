	<p class="paragraph">Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from
		the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the
		body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally
		expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and
		height in metres. The BMI may be determined using a table[note 1] or
		chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using
		contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may
		use other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the
		calculation). The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly
		categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or
		obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. That
		categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI
		scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed. Commonly
		accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight:
		18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30.</p>
